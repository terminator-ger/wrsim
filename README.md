## FAQ
___
Q: What is the difference between the draw and mutual destruction?

A: When there is a draw both sides still have ground units in the area after the battle and it remains contested. 
When there is a mutual destruction no ground units on both sides survive the combat, land areas remain with the defender. 
This is an important information for the attacker due to the pinning mechanics in the game.

A: For now i use a priority order to assign free hits (black and white dice) to the most valuable units first. 

Q: How does hit assignment for cruisers in escort stance work?

A: For sea units escort hits are prioritized to be taken for battleships over carriers.
